==================
The purpose of this app is to convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The user enters the temperature they want converted (e.g. 100) and the type of units of the temperature (c for Celsius and f for Fahrenheit).  The app will redisplay what the user entered and apply the appropriate conversion.  

The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is c*9/5 + 32.  So, if the user entered 100 and c, the app would return 212 which is the Fahrenheit equivalent of 100 degrees Celsius.

The formula to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius  is (f-32)*5/9.  So, if the user entered 212 and f, the app would return 100 which is the Celsius equivalent of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
